It takes 3.05 to read the file.


```{r}

  nrow(df_parking_tickets)==287458
})
```

1.1.2

The file is 79.8 mb

the full data set is 100 times this data set.
The number of rows is therefore 2,874,580 and the size of the file is 798 mb.

1.1.3



```{r}
na_count <-sapply(df_parking_tickets, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y)))))

na_count<-data.frame(na_count)

na_count
```


1.2.1 the number of tickets that were issues in the 1pct file were 287458.  Based on that the number of tickets issued in 2017 were 2,874,580 in Chicago.  The article states that the city of Chicago issues annually more than 3 million tickets.  This is not a significant difference as the article was written early in the year 2018 and exact information may not have been avaialble. 2.8 million is not far away from 3 million anyway.

1.2.2
Most frequent types of violations

```{r}
most_frequent_violations <- df_parking_tickets%>%
  group_by(violation_description)%>%

1.3.2



```{r}
df_unit_key <- read.csv("unit_key.csv")

# need to introduce a new variable unit to df_unit_key that is an integer as the previous variable "Reporting.District" is a character variable.
df_unit_key$unit<-as.integer(df_unit_key$"Reporting.District")

df_unit_key

```


there are 385 units

1.3.3


```{r}
df_join<-inner_join(df_parking_tickets, df_unit_key, by="unit")

df_join_na<-
  df_join %>% drop_na(unit)

df_join_na 

View(df_parking_tickets)
```

There are 287458 rows in the orignal table. In the new table there are 287429 rows.  The number of rows that have no units are therefore 29.

1.3.4.

```{r}
df_departments<-
  df_join_na %>%
  group_by(Department.Category) %>%
  summarise(n=n()) %>%
  arrange((desc(n)))

df_departments
```

Chicago police issued 127,078 tickets, Department of Finance issues 106,483 tickets.  Therefore Chicago police issued more tickents

```{r}
df_departments_CPD<-
  df_join_na %>%
  filter(Department.Category=="CPD") %>%

yes there are violation descriptions that are associated with more than one violation codes, for example 3-7 AM SNOW ROUTE which is associated with 0964060 and 0964060B

2.2.1



old violation code and description: 
0964125 NO CITY STICKER OR IMPROPER DISPLAY  fine level I: 120  Fine level II : 240


new violation code and description:
"0964125B" NO CITY STICKER VEHICLE UNDER/EQUAL TO 16,000 LBS. fine level I: 200  Fine level II : 400


Went into effect: 	
2012-02-25 00:00:00


2.2.2.

```{r}
df_parking_tickets%>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125" | violation_code=="0964125B") %>%
  mutate(date=as.Date(issue_date))%>%
  group_by(month=floor_date(date, "month"),violation_code) %>%
  summarize(n=n())%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month,y=n, color=violation_code))+
  geom_point()





```
2.2.3
the price increase went into effect:

2012-02-25 00:00:00


2.2.4.
```{r}
df_parking_tickets%>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125" | violation_code=="0964125B") %>%

  filter(date >= as.Date("2011-02-25"),date <= as.Date("2012-02-24" )) %>%
  summarise(n=n())



```
If 1% of the tickets were about 1917, then he total number of tickets per year were 191,700.  The higher fine did not induce more ticket sales, so the revenue only increased by the increase in fines = 200,000(new fine amoun less the old fine amount) = 191,700 * ($200-$120) = $15,336,000


2.2.5 & 2.2.6

Repayment rates


```{r}

  mutate(date=as.Date(issue_date))%>%
  mutate(payment_due=(current_amount_due>0))%>%
  group_by(month=floor_date(date, "month"),violation_code) %>%
  summarize(n=n(), p_d=sum(payment_due))%>%
  mutate(payment_rates=((1-p_d/n)*100))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month,y=payment_rates, color=violation_code))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2012-02-24"), linetype="dotted", 
                color = "blue", size=1.5)
  
```

repayment rates per year


```{r}
df_parking_tickets%>%
  filter(violation_code=="0964125" | violation_code=="0964125B") %>%
  mutate(date=as.Date(issue_date))%>%
  mutate(payment_due=(current_amount_due>0))%>%
  group_by(year=floor_date(date, "year"),violation_code) %>%
  summarize(n=n(), p_d=sum(payment_due))%>%
  mutate(payment_rates=((1-p_d/n)*100))

```
in 2011 the tickets were 1933
Revenue from the fines were 1933*66.6%*120*100 = 5,464,000

at the new repayment rates this would have been
                            1933*52.5%*200*100 = 20,296,500


in 2011 the tickets were 
Revenue from the fines were (-1191)*200*100 = 15,444,00


2.2.7

I would have fucused on higher rates for luxury cars as the owners could have afforded it
I would have given those that were driving cars with value of less than $1,000 free tickets
I would have had higher rates for cars with more pollution, size


2.2.8

street cleaning, snow routes etc, expired meters in business district
residential permits
